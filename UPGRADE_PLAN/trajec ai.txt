  context update and LLM model updates. So all new LLM models, and current active models and remove the depreceated models. Also we onley use Code 
  models to image genration , ect models you can ignore as they are completely usseless!. BASICLY ALL LLM PROVIDERS AND THERE MODELS SHOULD BE UP 
  TP DATE AS OF NOW 2025 do a web search of all cloudprovicers, add new cloud^provicers and there LLM UOPDATE CODE SO THE wwebapp can handle the 
  new models , providers , update the .env.example\
