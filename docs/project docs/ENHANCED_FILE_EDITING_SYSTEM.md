# Enhanced LLM File Editing System - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The original system showed errors like "This update modifies ~125% of a large file without a diff. Please resend as a unified diff so we can apply it safely." This occurred because:

1. **Conflicting Requirements**: Prompts instructed "FULL updated file contents (no diffs)" while protection mechanisms blocked large changes without unified diffs
2. **Token Inefficiency**: Full file rewrites wasted tokens on large files with small changes  
3. **Poor Error Recovery**: No guidance to help LLM understand how to format unified diffs properly
4. **No Contextual Intelligence**: System couldn't decide between full rewrites vs diffs based on change scope

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. **FileEditStrategyEngine** (`app/lib/utils/file-edit-strategy.ts`)

**Core Intelligence**: Analyzes files and determines optimal editing strategies

**Key Features**:
- **File Analysis**: Detects protected files, file size, binary content, change scope
- **Strategy Recommendation**: `full-rewrite`, `unified-diff`, `incremental`, or `create-new`
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-1 confidence in recommendations
- **Token Estimation**: Calculates token usage for different approaches

**Protected File Patterns**:
```typescript
- package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, package-lock.json
- .env files, .gitignore, tsconfig.json
- vite.config.js/ts files
```

**Decision Logic**:
- Protected files → unified diff (unless <20 lines)
- Large files (>200 lines) with <50% changes → unified diff
- Extensive changes (>50%) → full rewrite
- New files → create-new strategy

### 2. **SmartDiffProcessor** (`app/lib/utils/smart-diff-processor.ts`)

**Advanced Diff Handling**: Multi-format diff processing with validation

**Key Features**:
- **Format Detection**: Unified diff vs full content vs invalid format
- **Diff Validation**: Hunk header validation, line prefix checking, context verification
- **Safe Application**: Context matching, line number validation, error recovery
- **Optimization**: Token-efficient diff generation, minimal context lines
- **Smart Recommendations**: File-specific format suggestions with risk assessment

**Validation Capabilities**:
```typescript
interface DiffValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  format: 'unified' | 'full-content' | 'invalid';
  errors: string[];
  warnings: string[];
  suggestions: string[];
  tokenEstimate: number;
  lineCount: { added: number; removed: number; context: number };
}
```

### 3. **TokenOptimizer** (`app/lib/utils/token-optimizer.ts`)

**Token-Efficient Editing**: Chooses most efficient editing strategies

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-Strategy Analysis**: Full content, unified diff, incremental, chunked editing
- **Token Calculations**: Accurate estimates with overhead considerations
- **Efficiency Scoring**: 0-1 efficiency scores for each strategy
- **Chunking Strategy**: Handles very large files with prioritized chunks
- **Budget Awareness**: Respects token budget constraints

**Strategy Selection**:
```typescript
interface TokenAnalysis {
  strategy: 'unified-diff' | 'full-content' | 'incremental' | 'chunked';
  estimatedTokens: number;
  tokenSavings: number;
  efficiencyScore: number;
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  alternativeStrategies: Array<{strategy, tokens, pros, cons}>;
}
```

### 4. **EnhancedPromptBuilder** (`app/lib/utils/enhanced-prompt-builder.ts`)

**Context-Aware Prompting**: Generates intelligent editing guidance

**Key Features**:
- **File-Specific Guidance**: Tailored instructions per file type and context
- **Format Examples**: Unified diff templates with proper syntax
- **Best Practices**: Context-aware recommendations and common pitfall warnings
- **Adaptive Instructions**: Changes guidance based on file analysis and change scope

**Generated Guidance Types**:
- Protected file warnings and requirements
- Large file optimization strategies  
- Token optimization tips
- Format-specific examples and templates

### 5. **Enhanced Workbench Protection** (Updated `workbench.ts`)

**Intelligent Error Messages**: Context-aware blocking with actionable guidance

**Improvements**:
- **Strategy-Based Blocking**: Uses FileEditStrategyEngine for intelligent decisions
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Step-by-step guidance with examples
- **Format Templates**: Proper unified diff examples with line numbers
- **Token Analysis Integration**: Shows why decisions were made

**Enhanced Error Types**:
```typescript
// Before: Generic "Large overwrite blocked"
// After: Contextual guidance with specific examples

"**File:** package.json
**Analysis:** Protected file requires unified diff for safety
**Recommendations:**
- Use unified diff format instead of full file replacement
- Focus on specific changes rather than complete rewrites
**Template:**
@@ -15,3 +15,4 @@
 existing line
-line to remove  
+line to add
 existing line"
```

### 6. **Enhanced Message Parser** (Updated `message-parser.ts`)

**Smart Content Processing**: Validates and processes file edits intelligently

**Features**:
- **Format Detection**: Automatically detects unified diffs vs full content
- **Content Validation**: JSON syntax checking, diff format validation
- **Warning System**: Logs issues for debugging and improvement
- **Metadata Addition**: Tags content with format information

### 7. **Action Runner Integration** (Updated `action-runner.ts`)

**Enhanced Logging**: Better visibility into file operations

**Features**:
- **Operation Metadata**: Logs file size, line count, content format
- **Error Handling**: Improved error propagation and debugging info
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors file write operations

### 8. **Comprehensive Testing** (`app/lib/utils/__tests__/enhanced-file-editing.test.ts`)

**Complete Test Coverage**: Validates all components work together

**Test Categories**:
- **Strategy Engine Tests**: Protected file detection, size-based recommendations
- **Diff Processor Tests**: Format validation, application success/failure scenarios  
- **Token Optimizer Tests**: Efficiency calculations, recommendation accuracy
- **Prompt Builder Tests**: Context-aware instruction generation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows for common scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Protected File Editing (package.json)
```typescript
// 1. Analyze file
const context = fileEditStrategyEngine.analyzeFile('package.json', originalContent);
// Result: { isProtected: true, requiresUnifiedDiff: true }

// 2. Generate guidance  
const strategy = fileEditStrategyEngine.determineEditStrategy(context, options);
// Result: "Use unified diff format for safety"

// 3. Apply with validation
const result = smartDiffProcessor.applyDiff(unifiedDiff, originalContent);
// Result: Validated application with detailed error handling
```

### Large File with Small Changes
```typescript
// 1. Optimize strategy
const analysis = tokenOptimizer.analyzeOptimalStrategy({
  filePath: 'large.js',
  originalContent: largeFile,
  proposedContent: smallChange
});
// Result: { strategy: 'unified-diff', tokenSavings: 1200 }

// 2. Generate diff
const diff = smartDiffProcessor.convertToUnifiedDiff(proposed, original);
// Result: Optimized unified diff with minimal context
```
